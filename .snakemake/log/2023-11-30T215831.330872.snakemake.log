MissingOutputException in rule results in file /home/gerardo/Documentos/Gera/Taller/Proyecto/repo/snakefile, line 203:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 60 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/cluster/prueba_ref_genome_maps.csv
Removing output files of failed job results since they might be corrupted:
results/contig/prueba_ref_genome_maps.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
