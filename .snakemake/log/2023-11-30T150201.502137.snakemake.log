MissingOutputException in rule results in file /home/gerardo/Documentos/Gera/Taller/Proyecto/repo/snakefile, line 203:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/contig/prueba_ref_genome_maps.csv
results/cluster/prueba_ref_genome_maps.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
